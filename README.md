# UNet_TFgenerator
My version of UNet in a callable format that allows depth to be selected. 
I am currently interested in using UNet for biological segmentation. However, I couldn't find any straight forward implementation for TensorFlow.
Thus, I have decided to create my own UNet model for easy use, with the goal of having the depth of the model being a selectable parameter so that the model 
can be created for different instances.
